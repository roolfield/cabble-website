### How is the trip price calculated?

The ride price is determined by several factors. The car owner sets an hourly rate, and for each 24 hours, you pay a maximum of 10 times the hourly rate. Additionally, there is a price per kilometer beyond a certain included distance. Both of these factors are determined by the car owner. By combining these factors, you can arrive at an attractive ride price for both short and long journeys. Use the calculator to get an idea of how the ride price is structured.

### How is the fuel price determined?

The fuel price is calculated by multiplying the car's consumption by the current fuel price. The car's consumption is calculated by dividing the number of kilometers you drive by the car's consumption rate. The average consumption rate is determined by the car owner.

### What about refueling?

In principle, you always pay for the fuel you consume. There is one exception: if you pick up the car with a full tank and return it with a full tank, you can indicate this when returning the car, and you only pay the ride price, not the fuel. This way, you pay only for what you consume.

If you still need to refuel during the journey, arrange reimbursement with the owner directly. You pay for the consumed fuel through the app but get the refueled amount back. This way, you only pay for the fuel you consume.

### How do included kilometers work?

The car owner can specify a certain number of free kilometers per day included in the ride price. For longer journeys, the depreciation costs (the costs incurred by driving the car) increase. Therefore, the car owner can set a price per kilometer that you pay in addition to the included kilometers. Calculate the number of included kilometers by multiplying the number of days you rent the car by the included kilometers per day.

### What do I get as an owner?

As the owner of the car, you keep 93.5% of the ride price. You can use the calculator for the ride price calculation. For a manual calculation, see [How is the trip price calculated?](#how-is-the-trip-price-calculated)?.

### What do you pay for the app?

The app is free to download. From the ride price, you pay a 6.5% platform fee, mainly consisting of transaction costs. We try to keep these costs as low as possible so that you, as a sharer, keep as much as possible.

### When do I get paid?

After the driver completes the payment, you will be paid within 4 working days. It may take longer for the money to appear in your account due to delays with the bank.
