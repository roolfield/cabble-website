      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

      <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
        you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
        using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
        of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
        to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
        translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
        app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and
        other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
        Roolfield.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roolfield is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
        efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
        changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
        any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
        making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cabble app stores and processes personal data that you have provided
        to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep
        your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you
        do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
        software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
        system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
        malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
        features and it could mean that the Cabble app won’t work properly or at
        all.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and
        Conditions.

      <p>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that Roolfield will
        not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require
        the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
        Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Roolfield cannot
        take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you
        don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
        allowance left.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
        remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
        provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
        you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
        data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
        region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
        that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
        using the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, Roolfield cannot always take responsibility for
        the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device
        stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
        avail the Service, Roolfield cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to Roolfield’s responsibility for your use of the app, when
        you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we
        endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
        rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
        it available to you. Roolfield accepts no liability for any loss, direct
        or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
        functionality of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
        available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for both systems(and
        for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
        app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want
        to keep using the app. Roolfield does not promise that it will always
        update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
        Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device.
        However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
        offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
        terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to
        you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights
        and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop
        using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
      </p>

        manner prohibited under this agreement); (e) any inaccurate or
        incomplete information provided as part of the onboarding of the
        account.
      </p>

      <h2>Warranties</h2>

      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, except as expressly provided in
        this agreement, Roolfield provides Cabble to you on an “as is” “as

        statutory.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>

      <p>
        In no event will a Disclaiming Entity be liable for any lost profits, or
        any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary
        damages arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this
        agreement or Cabble, including the use of, inability to use, or
        unavailability of Cabble or the Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Disclaiming Entities have no liability or responsibility for any (a)
        personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting
        from use of Cabble or the Services; (b) damage, loss, or injury
        resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access to, or
        use of, Cabble, including any unauthorized access to or use of
        third-party servers used in connection with Cabble or the Services
        and/or any personal information stored therein; (c) interruption or
        cessation of Cabble; (d) errors, inaccuracies, or omissions of
        information, or any damages or losses incurred as a result of such
        errors inaccuracies or omissions, resulting from the use of Cabble; (e)
        information that is transmitted using Cabble that is defamatory,
        offensive, or illegal; and/or (f) conduct of any third party.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this section, the
        Disclaiming Entities’ cumulative liability to you in connection with
        Roolfield (including under this agreement) will be limited to direct
        damages and in all events will not exceed in the aggregate the amount of

        immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.
      </p>

      <p>
        This limitation of liability section applies to the maximum extent
        permitted by law, and applies regardless of the legal theory on which
        the claim is based, including contract, tort (including negligence,
        product liability, or otherwise), strict liability, or any other basis.
        The limitations apply even if the Disclaiming Entities have been advised
        of the possibility of such damage.
      </p>
